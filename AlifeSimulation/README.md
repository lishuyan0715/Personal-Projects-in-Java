Homework 4: A-Life Simulation

Creates a population and an AlifeSim driver to record the behaviors of
organisms in the population with inputted "time point". The population
consists of three different types of organisms: cooperators, defectors, and
partial cooperators. Enabling mutations gives a chance (~5%) for an
organism to produce an offspring of another species.

User input is given through command line arguments in the following format:
java ALifeSim <#/iterations> <#/cooperators> <#/defectors> <#/partial
cooperators> <#/Mutation enabled ("True"/"False")> <#/Random seed (long)>
